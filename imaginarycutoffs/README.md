To open, run

jekyll serve

and open on localhost:4000/Supplementary%20Information.html (or whichever port is given by the jekyll run).


-----------------

Old version:

To open the html file:
 - Open in Firefox
 - In a separate tab:
   - go to about:config
   - accept the warning
   - search for "unique"
   - double-click the setting `privacy.file_unique_origin` to set it to false
   - (don't forget to undo the damage)
