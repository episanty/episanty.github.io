The creation of the shortest flashes of light — laser pulses with durations in the order
of attoseconds — is typically achieved via high-order harmonic generation (HHG). In
this highly nonlinear optical effect, the interaction of atoms with ultra-strong light fields
causes the emission of a broad spectrum of harmonic frequencies. Ever since its discovery,
HHG has been described in terms of a ‘quantumorbits’ model based on several interfering
electron trajectories, thereby incorporating both quantum-mechanical effects and
an intuitive picture of classical dynamics. By tuning the parameters of the driving laser
field, the interplay between these trajectories can be controlled, shaping the emitted light.
Mathematically, this quantum orbit model is based on the expression of the harmonic response
in terms of a highly-oscillatory integral for the generated dipolemoment. Applying
saddle-point methods to this integral allows it to be decomposed into contributions from
distinct saddle points of the semi-classical action—analogous to Feynman’s path integral
formalism. Therewith, saddle-point methods provide the essential link between the fully
quantum-mechanical description of the process and the intuitive picture in terms of
classical electron trajectories. However, a rigorous framework for applying saddle-point
methods to highly-oscillatory integrals with algorithms that work uniformly for arbitrary
configurations and laser drivers, has previously not been established.

In this thesis, we introduce the key ideas of Picard-Lefschetz theory—the foundation
of all saddle-point approximations—and develop practical numerical methods for its
application. Thesemethods allowus to evaluate generic one- and two-dimensional highly-oscillatory
integrals across scans of external parameters and to identify contributions
from individual critical points of the integrand.

We apply these techniques to both strong-field ionisation and high-harmonic generation.
In particular, Picard–Lefschetzmethods allow us to uncover and analyse caustics.
Just as caustics appear in everyday life, when rays of light are reflected from curved
surfaces, they also arise in nonlinear optical processes, where they can produce prominent
enhancement features in HHG spectra. In these situations, multiple semi-classical
trajectories coalesce, causing traditional saddle-point approximations to break down
and rendering existing heuristics insufficient. Our techniques, however, work uniformly
across such caustic patterns. We showcase a wide range of parameter scans in which they
emerge and provide insight into features that could not previously be understood within
the standard framework. By enabling a deeper understanding of strong-field quantumorbit
dynamics, this thesis lays the foundation for controlling light-matter interactions on
ultrafast timescales, bridging theoretical understanding with the versatility of modern
experimental setups.
