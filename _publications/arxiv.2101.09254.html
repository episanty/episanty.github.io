We construct optical beams in free space with robust skyrmionic structures in their polarization fields, both in the electric spin vector for near-circular fields and in the polarization direction for near-linear fields, and for both Bloch (spiral) and Néel (hedgehog) textures. These structures are made possible by the spin-orbit coupling of tightly-focused nonparaxial optics as applied to higher-order Full-Poincaré beams, as well as by standing-wave configurations comprising forwards- and backwards-propagating waves. Our constructions show near-uniform circular and linear polarizations, providing a high degree of topological protection in the absence of nonlinear interactions, and they open the door to the use of topological light for the creation, detection and manipulation of skyrmions in magnetic devices and spinor condensates.
