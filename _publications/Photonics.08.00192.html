abstract: "<p>
Quantum-optical spectrometry is a recently developed shot-to-shot photon correlation-based method, namely using a quantum spectrometer (QS), that has been used to reveal the quantum optical nature of intense laser–matter interactions and connect the research domains of quantum optics (QO) and strong laser-field physics (SLFP). The method provides the probability of absorbing photons from a driving laser field towards the generation of a strong laser–field interaction product, such as high-order harmonics. In this case, the harmonic spectrum is reflected in the photon number distribution of the infrared (IR) driving field after its interaction with the high harmonic generation medium. The method was implemented in non-relativistic interactions using high harmonics produced by the interaction of strong laser pulses with atoms and semiconductors. Very recently, it was used for the generation of non-classical light states in intense laser–atom interaction, building the basis for studies of quantum electrodynamics in strong laser-field physics and the development of a new class of non-classical light sources for applications in quantum technology. Here, after a brief introduction of the QS method, we will discuss how the QS can be applied in relativistic laser–plasma interactions and become the driving factor for initiating investigations on relativistic quantum electrodynamics.
