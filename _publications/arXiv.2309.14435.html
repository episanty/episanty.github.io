abstract: "<p>
    High-harmonic generation has emerged as a pivotal process in strong-field physics, yielding extreme ultraviolet radiation and attosecond pulses with a wide range of applications. Furthermore, its emergent connection with the field of quantum optics has revealed its potential for generating non-classical states of light. Here, we investigate the process of high-harmonic generation in semiconductors under a quantum optical perspective while using a Bloch-based solid-state description. Through the implementation of quantum operations based on the measurement of high-order harmonics, we demonstrate the generation of non-classical light states similar to those found when driving atomic systems. These states are characterized using diverse quantum optical observables and quantum information measures, showing the influence of electron dynamics on their properties. Additionally, we analyze the dependence of their features on solid characteristics such as the dephasing time and crystal orientation, while also assessing their sensitivity to changes in driving field strength. This study provides insights into HHG in semiconductors and its potential for generating non-classical light sources.
