abstract: "<p>
The field of attosecond nanophysics, combining the research areas of attosecond physics with nanoscale physics, has experienced a considerable rise in recent years, both experimentally and theoretically. Its foundation rests on the subcycle manipulation and sampling of the coupled electron and near-field dynamics on the nanoscale. Attosecond nanophysics not only addresses questions of profound fundamental interest in strong-field lightâ€“matter interactions at the nanoscale, but also could eventually lead to a considerable number of applications in ultrafast, petahertz-scale electronics, and ultrafast metrology for microscopy or nanoscopy. In this Perspective, we outline the current frontiers, challenges, and future directions in the field, with particular emphasis on the development of petahertz electronics and attosecond nanoscopy.
