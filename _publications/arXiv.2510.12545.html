Light-matter interactions within the strong-field regime, where intense laser fields can ionise a target via tunnelling, give rise to fascinating phenomena such as the generation of high-order harmonic radiation (HHG). On the atomic scale, these strong-field processes are described in terms of highly-oscillatory time integrals which are often approximated using saddle-point methods. These methods simultaneously simplify the calculations and let us understand the physical processes in terms of semi-classical electron trajectories, or quantum orbits. However, applying saddle-point methods for HHG driven by polychromatic laser fields without clear dynamical symmetries has remained challenging. Here we introduce Picard-Lefschetz theory as a universal and robust link between the time integrals and the semi-classical trajectories. The continuous deformation of the integration contour towards so-called Lefschetz thimbles allows an exact evaluation of the integral, as well as the identification of relevant quantum orbits, for arbitrary driving fields. The latter is realised via the \"necklace algorithm\", a novel solution to the open problem of determining the relevance of saddle points for a two-dimensional integral, which we introduce here. We demonstrate the versatility and rigour of Picard-Lefschetz methods by studying Stokes transitions and spectral caustics arising in HHG driven by two-colour laser fields. For example, we showcase a quantum-orbit analysis of the colour switchover, which links the regime of perturbative two-colour fields with that of fully bichromatic driving fields. With this work, we set the foundation for a rigorous application of quantum-orbit based approaches in attosecond science that enables the interpretation of state-of-the-art experimental setups, and guides the design of future ones.
