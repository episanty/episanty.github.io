abstract: "<p>
We construct optical beams in free space with robust skyrmionic structures in their polarization fields, both in the electric spin vector for near-circular fields and in the polarization direction for near-linear fields, and for both Bloch (spiral) and Néel (hedgehog) textures. These structures are made possible by the spin–orbit coupling of tightly-focused nonparaxial optics as applied to higher-order Full-Poincaré beams, as well as by standing-wave configurations comprising forwards- and backwards-propagating waves. Our constructions show near-uniform circular and linear polarizations, providing a high degree of topological protection in the absence of nonlinear interactions.
