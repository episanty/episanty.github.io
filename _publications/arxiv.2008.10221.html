High-harmonic generation is one of the most fundamental processes in strong laser-field physics that has led to countless achievements in atomic physics and beyond. However, a rigorous quantum electrodynamical picture of the process has never been reported. Here, we prove rigorously and demonstrate experimentally that the quantum state of the driving laser field, as well as that of harmonics, is coherent. Projecting this state on its part corresponding to harmonic generation, it becomes a superposition of a state, amplitude-shifted due to the quantum nature of light, and the initial state of the laser. This superposition interpolates between a Schrödinger \"kitten\", and a genuine Schrödinger \"cat\" state. This work opens new paths for ground-breaking investigations in strong laser-field physics and quantum technology. We dedicate the work to the memory of Roy J. Glauber, the inventor of coherent states.
