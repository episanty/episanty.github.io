abstract: "<p>
We introduce an alternative definition of the main frequency of an ultrashort laser pulse, the principal frequency $\\omega_P$. This parameter is complementary to the most accepted and widely used carrier frequency $\\omega_0$. Given the fact that these ultrashort pulses, also known as transients, have a temporal width comprising only few cycles of the carrier wave, corresponding to a spectral bandwidth $\\Delta\\omega$ covering several octaves, $\\omega_P$ describes, in a more precise way, the dynamics driven by these sources. We present examples where, for instance, $\\omega_P$ is able to correctly predict the high-order harmonic cutoff independently of the carrier envelope phase. This is confirmed by solving the time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation in reduced dimensions, supplemented with the time-analysis of the quantum spectra, where it is possible to observe how the sub-cycle electron dynamics is better described using $\\omega_P$. The concept of $\\omega_P$, however, can be applied to a large variety of scenarios, not only within the strong field physics domain.
