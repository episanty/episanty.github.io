<p>
ComplexFocus is a Mathematica package that implements the Complex Focus fields, a family of vector beam solutions in nonparaxial optics, obtained by shifting the spherical multipole solutions by a complex offset. It provides flexible and workable analytical functions which solve the Maxwell equations at full rigour for a tightly-focused vector beam.
