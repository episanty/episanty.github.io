<p>
RB-SFA is a compact and flexible Mathematica package for calculating High Harmonic Generation emission within the Strong Field Approximation. It combines Mathematica's analytical integration capabilities with its numerical calculation capacities to offer a fast and user-friendly plug-and-play solver for calculating HHG spectra and other properties. In addition, it can calculate first-order nondipole corrections to the SFA results to evaluate the effect of the driving laser's magnetic field on harmonic spectra. There is also a (currently undocumented) section for calculating spectra using quantum-orbit methods.
