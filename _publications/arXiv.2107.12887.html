abstract: "<p>
We present a theoretical demonstration on the generation of entangled coherent states and of coherent state superpositions, with photon numbers and energies orders of magnitude higher than those provided by the current technology. This is achieved by utilizing a quantum mechanical multimode description of the single- and two-color intense laser field driven process of high harmonic generation in atoms. It is found that all field modes involved in the high harmonic generation process are entangled, and upon performing a quantum operation, leads to the generation of high photon number non-classical coherent state superpositions spanning from the far infrared to the extreme-ultraviolet spectral region. These states can be considered as a new resource for fundamental tests of quantum theory and quantum information processing.
