The quantum optical characterization of strongly laser-driven matter interactions may allow to extend current quantum technology platforms to unprecedented time and energy scales. In this work, we make a step forward in this direction by studying high-harmonic generation processes in solid-state systems under a quantum optical framework. We do this under a Wannier-Bloch approach, which allows us to perform a direct comparison with the analysis that has been already done for gaseous systems. This allows us to study the photon number probability distribution of the light obtained after emission, and relate its features with those found in usual HHG spectra. Furthermore, after performing the corresponding quantum operations that allow us to restrict ourselves to HHG processes, we find an entangled state between the field modes and the different Wannier states where the electron can be found after recombination, but also between the field modes themselves. We study the non-classical features of this state, and quantify the light-matter entanglement and the entanglement between the field modes.
