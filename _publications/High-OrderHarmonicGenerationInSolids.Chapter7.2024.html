abstract: "<p>
Quantum optics stands as one of the most promising platforms for practical applications in quantum information science, with light serving as the primary carrier of information [1–3]. To advance such applications, non-classical states of light are necessary — states inherently described by quantum electrodynamics tools [4]. Some of the available non-classical light sources rely on nonlinear interactions between light and matter [5], and one of the most striking examples of these interactions is high-order harmonic generation (HHG) [6, 7]. In HHG, a strong, pulsed laser ﬁeld interacts with matter, resulting in the emission of radiation, emitted as a periodic series of ultrashort harmonics of the driving laser, spanning numerous harmonic orders [8]. While semiclassical theoretical descriptions of HHG processes — where light is treated classically while the matter system is treated quantum mechanically — suﬃce to replicate most experimental results, they leave untapped the potential of strong-ﬁeld physics in quantum optics.

Recent years have witnessed renewed attraction in analyzing strong-ﬁeld processes from a quantum optical perspective [9, 10]. This surge in interest corresponds to the observation of strong laser-matter interactions being useful for creating non-classical states. For example, by means of HHG processes in atomic systems it is possible to generate non-classical states of light [11–16] with intensities enough to drive nonlinear processes in matter [17], as well as massively frequency-entangled states [18, 19], light-matter entangled states [20, 21], and high-photon-number squeezed states [22, 23]. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the use of non-classical light sources can signiﬁcantly impact electron dynamics [24–26], resulting in extended and better-resolved harmonic spectra [27], as well as leading to new paradigms regarding the semiclassical interpretation of HHG processes [28, 29].

In this chapter, we delve into recent ﬁndings in solid-state systems, speciﬁcally semiconductor materials, along these lines where the quantum optical behavior is brought to attention. These systems have been recently analyzed in Ref. [30], demonstrating that the band structure of solids lead to non-trivial eﬀects on the quantum optical state of the system. However, the content presented in this chapter builds upon Refs. [31, 32], which provide a quantum optical description of strongly driven light-matter interactions using two distinct basis sets to characterize the electronic system. Although yielding similar outcomes, these diﬀerent approaches oﬀer diverse insights into electron dynamics and provide more suitable frameworks for computing
speciﬁc quantum information measures.
