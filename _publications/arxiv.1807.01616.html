abstract: "<p>
Topological materials are of interest to both fundamental sciences and advanced technologies, because topological states are robust with respect to perturbations and dissipation, protected by topological invariants or underlying symmetries, i.e.~time-reversal, inversion, particle-hole or other symmetries. Experimental detection of topological invariant is thus of great demand, but is extremely challenging. Ultrafast laser-matter interactions, leading to high harmonic generation (HHG) or laser-induced electron diffraction (LIED), were proposed several years ago to explore the structural and dynamical properties of various matter targets. Here, we show that HHG can be used to detect topological phases and phase transitions in the paradigmatic Haldane model. Analyzing intra- and inter-band currents via our theoretical approach, we find evidences to show that even and odd harmonics as well as their emitted intensities are sensitive to crossing a topological phase boundary. Our findings pave the way to understand fundamental questions regarding the complex ultrafast electron-hole pairs dynamics in topological materials by means of HHG.
