abstract: "<p>
Topological materials are of interest to both fundamental sciences and advanced technologies, because topological states are robust with respect to perturbations and dissipation. Experimental detection of topological invariants is thus in great demand, but is extremely challenging. Ultrafast laser-matter interactions, and in particular high-harmonic generation (HHG), were proposed several years ago as tools to explore the structural and dynamical properties of various matter targets. Here, we show that the high-harmonic generation signal produced by circularly-polarized lasers contains distinct signatures of the topological phase transition in the paradigmatic Haldane model. In addition to clear shifts of the overall intensity emissivity and harmonic cutoff, the HHG shows an unique circular dichroism which exhibits clear changes in behaviour at the topological phase boundary. Our findings pave the way to understand fundamental questions about the ultrafast electron-hole pair dynamics in topological materials via HHG.
