abstract: "<p>
A precise understanding of mechanisms governing the dynamics of electrons in atoms and molecules subjected to intense laser fields has a key meaning for the description of phenomena such as the high-harmonic generation and ionization. From the theoretical point of view this is still a challenging task, as the currently existing methods of solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation are characterized with either limited accuracy, or limited applicability. In this paper we explore the method of expanding the wavefunction of the examined system into a linear combination of atom-centered basis functions, and present a novel systematic scheme for constructing an optimal Gaussian basis set suitable for the description of excited and continuum atomic or molecular states. We analyze the performance of the proposed basis sets by performing a series of time-dependent configuration interaction calculations for the hydrogen atom in fields of intensity varying from 5x10^13 W/cm2 to 5x10^14 W/cm2. We also compare the results with data obtained using Gaussian basis sets proposed previously by other authors.
