The fundamental polarization singularities of monochromatic light are normally associated with invariance under coordinated rotations: symmetry operations that rotate the spatial dependence of an electromagnetic field by an angle $\\theta$ and its polarization by a multiple $\\gamma\\theta$ of that angle. These symmetries are generated by mixed angular momenta of the form $J_\\gamma = L + \\gamma S$ and they generally induce Möbius-strip topologies, with the coordination parameter $\\gamma$ restricted to integer and half-integer values. In this work we construct beams of light that are invariant under coordinated rotations for arbitrary $\\gamma$, by exploiting the higher internal symmetry of 'bicircular' superpositions of counter-rotating circularly polarized beams at different frequencies. We show that these beams have the topology of a torus knot, which reflects the subgroup generated by the torus-knot angular momentum $J_\\gamma$, and we characterize the resulting optical polarization singularity using third-and higher-order field moment tensors, which we experimentally observe using nonlinear polarization tomography.
