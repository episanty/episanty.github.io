abstract: "The ionization of atoms by strong, low-frequency fields can generally be described well by assuming that the photoelectron is, after the ionization step, completely at the mercy of the laser field. However, certain phenomena, like the recent discovery of low-energy structures (LESs) in the long-wavelength regime, require the inclusion of the Coulomb interaction with the ion once the electron is in the continuum. We explore the first-principles inclusion of this interaction, known as analytical R-matrix theory, and its consequences on the corresponding quantum orbits. We show that the trajectory must have an imaginary component, and that this causes branch cuts in the complex time plane when the real trajectory revisits the neighborhood of the ionic core. We provide a framework for consistently navigating these branch cuts based on closest-approach times, which satisfy the equation r(t)v(t)=0 in the complex plane. We explore the geometry of these roots and describe the geometrical structures underlying the emergence of LESs in both the classical and quantum domains."
