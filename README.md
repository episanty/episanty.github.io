#Welcome!
### to episanty.github.io

This repository is the back end of http://episanty.github.io/, which currently has a draft of the supplementary information of my latest paper. Head on over there to see how they look like, or clone this repository to your machine for a (somewhat faster) local copy. Drop me a line if you ended in here somehow and want to know what the whole thing is all about.
