# Welcome!

This is the back-end of my personal website, [**episanty.github.io**](https://episanty.github.io). You can head on over there to see the content, or you can use this repository to see how it is built.

To run this locally, simply run

    jekyll serve

on the root directory, and load `http://localhost:4000/`.


This website is based on the [Wall-E Jekyll template](https://github.com/abhn/Wall-E) by Abhishek Nagekar.


To get this running on a new (linux) machine, 
 - install jekyll:
   $ sudo apt-get install jekyll
 - install the jekyll-paginate gem:
   $ gem install jekyll-paginate
